# Fixing Python Compatibility

The project requires **Python 3.11** (or 3.12) because libraries like `numpy`, `opencv-python`, and `mediapipe` are not yet compatible with your installed version (Python 3.14).

## Steps to Fix

1.  **Download Python 3.11**
    *   I have triggered the download for you.
    *   If it didn't start, click here: [Download Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe)

2.  **Run the Installer**
    *   **CRITICAL**: Check the box **[x] Add Python to PATH** at the bottom of the first screen.
    *   Click **Install Now**.
    *   Wait for it to finish.

3.  **Verify & Continue**
    *   Close your current terminals.
    *   Open a new terminal.
    *   Type: `done` in the chat here.
    *   I will then run the setup commands for you.
